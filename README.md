## FinalProjekt_WebGL

# Overview
This WebGL application, built with Three.js, showcases interactive 3D models with custom shaders and post-processing effects. The environment is designed to be dynamic and responsive, featuring draggable and scrollable elements for an engaging user experience.


Concept and Decisions

Shadows
Decided not to use shadows for the character to keep performance high, as shadows are not crucial for this project.

Camera Movement
Added subtle orbit camera movements to make the scene more dynamic.

Model Optimization
Reduced vertex count for each model to improve performance.

Character Creation
Created the 3D character with Ready Player Me and animations with MoveONE AI. Encountered texture issues during export.

Challenges
Character and Animations: Difficulty in applying custom animations to the character.

Smooth Animation Switching: Managed to smoothly transition animations with scroll interactions.

Performance Issues: Faced and mitigated various performance challenges.

Dragging Logic: Implemented complex dragging interactions.

Stencils/Shaders: Struggled with stencils and shaders, and integrating environment maps.

Lighting GUI: Integrated and configured the lighting GUI, facing several challenges.
